## Task
### Topic: 
IEEE-754 Binary-64 floating point converter (including all special cases)
- Input: (1) binary mantissa and base-2 (i.e., 101.01x25) (2) Decimal and base-10 (i.e. 65.0x103). Also should support special cases (i.e., NaN).
- Output: (1) binary output with space between section (2) its hexadecimal equivalent (3) with option to output in text file.

### Application platform:
- Stand-alone with GUI (graphics user interface) using a library in python called tkinter

### Programming language: 
- Python

## Analysis Writeup:
### How to Run the Program:

### Test cases:
#### Test Case 1: binary mantissa and base-2
- Screenshot of the program output
- Brief Explanation of screenshot, input, and tutput: (1) binary output with space between section (2) its hexadecimal equivalent (3) with option to output in text file.



#### Test Case 2: Decimal and base-10 
- Screenshot of the program output
- Brief Explanation

#### Test Case 3: Special case NaN
- Screenshot of the program output
- Brief Explanation of screenshot, input, and tutput: (1) binary output with space between section (2) its hexadecimal equivalent (3) with option to output in text file.

#### Test Case 3: Special case _____
- Screenshot of the program output (all possible test cases that will cover the specifications (normal, special case, different inputs, etc.)
- Brief Explanation of screenshot, input, and tutput: (1) binary output with space between section (2) its hexadecimal equivalent (3) with option to output in text file.

#### Test Case ... (add more as needed)

#### Test Case N: None of the above (error catching)
- Screenshot of the program output
- Brief Explanation of screenshot, input, and tutput: (1) binary output with space between section (2) its hexadecimal equivalent (3) with option to output in text file.
  
### Key Takeaways:

### Short video 
  * insert github link redirecting to short video location - (Showing program compilation is correct and showing all test cases that will cover the specifications (normal, special case, different inputs, etc.)
