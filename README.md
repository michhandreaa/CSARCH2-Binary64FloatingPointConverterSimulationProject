# Application platform:
-Stand-alone with GUI (graphics user interface) using a library in python called tkinter

# Programming languages: Python

# Task
IEEE-754 Binary-64 floating point converter (including all special cases)
- Input: (1) binary mantissa and base-2 (i.e., 101.01x25) (2) Decimal and base-10 (i.e. 65.0x103). Also should support special cases (i.e., NaN).
â€¢ Output: (1) binary output with space between section (2) its hexadecimal equivalent (3) with option to output in text file.

# Analysis Writeup:
## How to Run the Program:

## Test cases:
### Test Case 1:
- Screenshot of the program output (all possible test cases that will cover the specifications (normal, special case, different inputs, etc.)

### Test Case 2:
- Screenshot of the program output (all possible test cases that will cover the specifications (normal, special case, different inputs, etc.)

### Test Case 3: (add more as needed)
- Screenshot of the program output (all possible test cases that will cover the specifications (normal, special case, different inputs, etc.)

## Key Takeaways:

## Short video (Showing program compilation is correct and showing all test cases that will cover the specifications (normal, special case, different inputs, etc.)
